# 🛠️ playbook-swift-prototype Setup Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you set up Xcode for prototyping quickly and efficiently. Let's get started! 🚀

## Steps

1. **📥 Download Xcode**  
   Head to the App Store and download Xcode. Be prepared; this might take a while!

2. **🔗 Clone the Repository**  
   Visit GitHub and navigate to the “powerhome” account. Look for the `playbook-swift-prototype` repository in the list and clone it using the SSH option.

3. **📂 Open in Xcode**  
   Launch Xcode and choose “Clone Git Repository.” Paste the cloned repository link into the search field and hit “clone.” Feel free to rename the project as you like!

4. **🛠️ Explore & Modify**  
   Once cloned, check out the `ContentView` in the file navigator on the left side of Xcode to see an example of Playbook Swift in action. You can delete the existing code and start building your own views with   Playbook Swift components! 
   Remember to add `import Playbook` at the top of any new files you create.

## Example View

Here’s an example view demonstrating how to use one of our kits:

## 🔄 Keep Components Updated

If you’re missing a component or want to ensure the Playbook components are current, use the “Integrate” button in Xcode’s top menu bar, choose “Pull,” and pull from Main.

 **Happy Coding!** 🎉
